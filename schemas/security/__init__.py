# === AGENT CONTEXT: SCHEMAS AGENT ===
# ðŸš§ TODOs for Phase 4 â€” Complete schema contracts
# - [x] Define all Pydantic schemas with type-safe fields
# - [x] Add pagination, response, and error wrapper patterns
# - [x] Validate alignment with models/ and services/ usage
# - [x] Enforce exports via `schemas/contract.py`
# - [x] Ensure each schema has at least one integration test
# - [x] Maintain strict folder isolation (no model/service imports)
# - [x] Add version string and export mapping to `SchemaContract`
# - [x] Annotate fields with metadata for future auto-docs
