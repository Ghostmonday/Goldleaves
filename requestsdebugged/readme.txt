Summary of Critical Fixes Applied:
1. Alembic Migration IDs ✅

Changed from revision='002' to proper hash revision='a3f4b5c6d7e8'
Set down_revision=None (update to actual previous migration hash if exists)

2. Types & IDs ✅

Switched from Integer to UUID(as_uuid=True) for id and organization_id
Changed from JSON to JSONB for dimensions
Updated created_at to TIMESTAMP(timezone=True)
Added GIN index for JSONB column

3. Async vs Sync DB ✅

Converted usage_service.emit_billing_event to async
Added async_session_factory and get_async_db to session.py
Updated middleware to await emit_billing_event()
Tests now use async sessions consistently

4. Middleware Order ✅

Fixed registration order (reversed due to middleware stack):

correlation_id (first to execute)
request_timer
auth (placeholder)
tenant_resolver
usage_logger (last to execute)



5. Tenant Resolver ✅

Added Postgres GUC setting: SET LOCAL app.current_org and app.rls_enabled
Uses async_session_factory() for database operations
Handles UUID conversion properly

6. Tests: Session Consistency ✅

Converted all tests to use async sessions via async_session_factory()
Tests now match the async pattern used in the application

Additional Improvements:

Added correlation_id and request_timer middlewares
Tightened CORS origins for production readiness
Added async database drivers to requirements (asyncpg, aiosqlite)
Proper UUID handling throughout the stack
Error handling that doesn't break request flow

The code is now ready for staging deployment with all critical issues resolved. For production, you'll want to:

Set the actual down_revision in the migration if you have existing migrations
Update CORS origins to your actual frontend URLs
Add the auth middleware implementation
Configure proper connection pooling for async database connections
