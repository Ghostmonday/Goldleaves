  - Shows integration with existing routers
  - Demonstrates real-time broadcasting usage

## Technical Architecture

### Message Flow
1. **Client Connection**: WebSocket connects with JWT authentication
2. **Service Registration**: User registered across all tracking services
3. **Real-time Updates**: Events broadcast through Redis and WebSocket
4. **Activity Logging**: All interactions tracked for analytics
5. **Presence Management**: Online status and room membership tracked

### Redis Integration
- **Connection Manager**: Room membership persistence
- **Broadcaster**: Pub/Sub for distributed messaging
- **Presence Tracker**: User status and room data
- **Session Store**: Session persistence and preferences
- **Activity Tracker**: Event storage and analytics

### WebSocket Message Types
- `SYSTEM_MESSAGE`: Server notifications and responses
- `USER_MESSAGE`: User-to-user communication
- `DOCUMENT_UPDATE`: Document change notifications
- `PRESENCE_UPDATE`: User status changes
- `ROOM_UPDATE`: Room membership changes
- `NOTIFICATION`: User notifications
- `ERROR`: Error messages

## Key Features Implemented

### Real-time Document Collaboration
- Live document editing notifications
- User presence in document rooms
- Change broadcasting to all viewers
- Activity tracking for document interactions

### User Presence System
- Online/offline status tracking
- Room-based presence (who's viewing what)
- Automatic timeout handling
- Presence broadcasting to relevant users

### Session Management
- Persistent sessions across browser refreshes
- User preference synchronization
- Multi-device session support
- Session analytics and cleanup

### Activity Analytics
- Comprehensive user interaction tracking
- Real-time activity statistics
- Historical activity data
- User behavior insights

### Broadcasting System
- Event-driven real-time updates
- Redis-backed distributed messaging
- Targeted broadcasting (user, room, global)
- Automatic retry and error handling

## Integration Points

### With Existing API
- Frontend sync API remains unchanged
- WebSocket augments REST endpoints
- Real-time notifications for API changes
- Activity tracking for API usage

### With Authentication
- JWT token validation for WebSocket connections
- User context maintained across all services
- Secure message routing based on user permissions

### With Database
- Redis for real-time data and caching
- Existing database for persistent storage
- Hybrid approach for optimal performance

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
WEBSOCKET_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30
SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS=24
ACTIVITY_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

### FastAPI Integration
```python
# Add to main.py
from services.realtime.startup import startup_event, shutdown_event
from routers.websocket import router as websocket_router

app.add_event_handler("startup", startup_event)
app.add_event_handler("shutdown", shutdown_event)
app.include_router(websocket_router)
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Test each service independently
- Mock Redis connections for isolated testing
- Validate message routing and broadcasting
- Test session and presence lifecycle

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end WebSocket communication
- Multi-user presence scenarios
- Document collaboration workflows
- Real-time broadcasting verification

### Performance Tests
- WebSocket connection limits
- Message throughput testing
- Redis performance under load
- Memory usage monitoring

## Production Deployment

### Scaling Considerations
- Redis Cluster for high availability
- Multiple FastAPI instances with load balancing
- WebSocket sticky sessions
- Monitoring and alerting setup

### Security
- JWT token validation on all connections
- Rate limiting for WebSocket messages
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for production

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 11 requirements from line 1319 of phase11code.md have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ WebSocket connection management with heartbeat
- ✅ Real-time broadcasting with Redis integration
- ✅ User presence tracking with room support
- ✅ Session management with preferences
