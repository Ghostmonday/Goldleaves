PR #14 quick review checklist
• API contract: /billing/summary = { plan, cycle_start, cycle_end, total_calls, est_cost_cents, next_invoice }.
• Auth/tenancy: derive tenant_id/user_id once; no cross-tenant leakage.
• Mock toggle: BILLING_MOCK=1 → mock; off → live later.
• Tests: happy path + unauthorized; date math in UTC.
• UI: summary card aligns with theme; mobile OK; errors show a non-blocking banner.

Looks good. Please add:
1) Env toggle BILLING_MOCK=1, fallback to live later.
2) UTC only; include cycle_start/cycle_end ISO strings.
3) Tenancy guard: assert tenant_id present; return 401/403 if missing.
4) Tests: mock on/off; unauthorized; snapshot of response shape.
5) Docs: brief section in BILLING.md.
